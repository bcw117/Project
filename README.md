# Regression Analysis of Electrical Output of Wind Turbines

The goal of this project is to use the characteristics of wind turbines from 1983 to 2021 to create a regression model that can accurately predict the electrical generation capacity of a wind turbine (kW). This project uses Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Bokeh. 

It utilizes the following regression techniques:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression (with Cross Validation)
- Principal Component Analysis
